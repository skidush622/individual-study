meta-handheld
=============

This layer is for maintenance of support for old (and some not so old) 
handheld devices, including Sharp Zaurus, HP iPAQ etc, initially based upon
recipes from OpenEmbedded master. Note that some machines may have suffered
from bitrot and need work, your help would be appreciated!
