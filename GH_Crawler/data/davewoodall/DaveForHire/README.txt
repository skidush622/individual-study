I've made sacrifices to become a full stack programmer.

For example, I moved my family from Denver to Florida for three months so that I could attend Code Academy (Now Starter League), in Chicago. That fanned my passion for web development and I decided to sell my business to focus 100% on my new journey toward software craftsmanship.

Since then, I've been an unofficial intern at Pivotal Labs with my nose down in code, books, and tutorials for 10-12 hours days.

It's time to apply what I've learned!
