Tomcat deployment
-----------------

If you want to deploy the war on Tomcat, you must define a JNDI resource for the database. The name is `jdbc/bankit`

Here is the steps to configure a MySQL database :

1. Create a database on your MySQL server then add a user with all rights on it

2. Copy the [MySQL driver](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.27/mysql-connector-java-5.1.27.jar) into the tomcat `lib/` directory

3. Add the following resource into the Tomcat `conf/context.xml` file, between `<Context>` tags :

```xml
<Resource 
	auth="Container" 
	driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" 
	factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
	name="jdbc/bankit" 
	username="bankit"
	password="bankitpass" 
	type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
	url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bankit"
	testOnBorrow="true"
	validationQuery="SELECT 1" 
/>
```

Then you can deploy the war as usual (put into webapps folder) !
